# NMG Identity Automation With Powershell

PowerShell tooling for identity lifecycle management, built for a fictional company called Northstar Medical Group.

## The Problem

Northstar had no way to know when someone left. Offboarding ran through one employee, manually, by email. When
she retired, the emails stopped, and nobody noticed for 102 days. A manual sweep finally caught 23 stale accounts.
It took 11 hours over 4 days. But it only found what it knew to look for. 

It missed:
• Departures that were never recorded
• Contractors who never touched payroll
• Service accounts that were never people 

Zero automation. Zero alerts. One point of failure holding up the entire offboarding process, 
and no idea how muchit had already missed. 


## The Approach

Instead of cross-checking the directory records against payroll manually. A process that 
only works if the paperwork gets filed and the names actually match. These tools go straight to the source. 

They query the domain controller directly  for eacxh account's last authentication date. 
No paperwork. No name mathching. No trusting that HR and IT are in sync. 

If an account hasn't logged in, the domain controller knows, regardless of what
any spreadsheet says. 

## Before you start

- Windows Server with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module

      Import-Module ActiveDirectory

- Rights to modify user objects in the domain
- An authorising ticket number, in the form NMG-0000
- A Disabled Users OU at the root of the domain
- A writable reports folder. Create it if it does not exist:

      New-Item -Path "C:\Reports\Offboarding" -ItemType Directory -Force


## Tools

### Find-StaleAccounts.ps1

Identifies enabled accounts that have not authenticated within a given
number of days, including accounts that have never authenticated.
Exports a timestamped CSV plus a summary recording the exact query used.

    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 30
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 180 -IncludeDisabled

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Days` | int | 90 | Days without authentication before an account is considered stale |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports | Where reports are written |
| `-IncludeDisabled` | switch | off | Include disabled accounts in results |

**Output:** a timestamped CSV of findings, and a summary file recording
the question that produced them so the report can be reproduced.

### Offboard-NMGUser.ps1

Performs all five steps of SOP-IAM-001 against a single account.
Documents the account and its group memberships, verifies that
record on disk, disables the account, stamps the authorising
ticket, removes all group memberships, and moves the account to
the Disabled Users OU.

    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214" -WhatIf
    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214"

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Username` | string | required | SamAccountName of the account to offboard |
| `-Ticket` | string | required | Authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000 |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports\Offboarding | Where evidence files are written |
| `-LogPath` | string | Logs\ | Where the run transcript is written |
| `-WhatIf` | switch | off | Runs every check and changes nothing |

**Output:** two timestamped CSV files per account recording what
it was and what it could reach, plus a transcript of the run.

### Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

Reports how many accounts have been offboarded and quarantined,
how many are offboarded but not yet moved, and how many are still
waiting. Takes no parameters and makes no changes of any kind.

    .\Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

**Output:** three counts and two named lists, printed to the
console. Nothing is written to disk.

## When the script refuses

A refusal is the tool working correctly. It stops before making
any change at all, and tells you why.

| Message | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| no account named X | The username is wrong, or the account is already gone | Check the spelling in Active Directory |
| already disabled | Somebody has handled this one before you | Read the description field for the ticket number |
| looks like a service account | This is not a person | Find the owner. It needs a different procedure |
| ticket should look like NMG-0000 | The ticket format is wrong | Use the full four digit form |
| export file is empty | The record could not be written | Check the reports folder exists and is writable |
| Disabled Users OU not found | The destination is missing | Steps 1 to 4 completed. Move the account by hand |

## What an offboarding leaves behind

- Two timestamped CSV files per account in `Evidence/`. One
  records the account, one records every group it could reach.
- One transcript per run in `Logs/`, naming every membership
  removed.
- The authorising ticket number stamped on the account
  description in Active Directory.

The CSV of group memberships is the only record that will ever
exist of what an account could reach beforehand. Active Directory keeps no
history of a removed memberships.

## Known limitations

- Three accounts were offboarded before step 5 was implemented
  and were moved into the Disabled Users OU manually afterwards.
  Their logs do not record the move.
- Handles one account per run. Bulk processing is not built yet.
- The service account check matches on a name prefix and a
  department. An unusually named service account could get past it.

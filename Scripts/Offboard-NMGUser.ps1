<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Performs a complete offboarding of a single Active
    Directory account, per SOP-IAM-001.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs all five steps. Documents the account and its group
    memberships, verifies that record on disk, disables the
    account, stamps the authorising ticket, randomises the
    password, removes all group memberships, and moves the
    account to the Disabled Users OU.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214" -WhatIf
    Runs every check and reports what it would do, changing
    nothing. Do this first, every time.


.PARAMETER Username
    The SamAccountName of the account to offboard. Mandatory.

.PARAMETER Ticket
    The authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000. Mandatory.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Disable-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "hgrady" -Ticket "NMG-0211" -WhatIf
    Runs every check and reports what it would do, changing nothing.

#--- STEP 2: DISABLE ----------------------------------------

#--- EDIT 3: THE ACTUAL FIX ---------------------------------
# Your script already has a ShouldProcess block. It protects
# the disabled. Leave that one exactly as it is.
#
# This is a SECOND one, and it goes directly after the
# disable block's closing brace.
#
# Delete the loop you pasted at the bottom in Phase 1, then
# paste this in its place.

#--- EDIT 1: CHECK THE DESTINATION --------------------------
# Goes AFTER the group removal block, BEFORE the move.
#
# A missing OU fails at the very end of an otherwise perfect
# run, leaving the account everywhere except where it belongs.

#--- EDIT 2: BUILD THE TARGET PATH --------------------------
# Get-ADDomain hands you the root at runtime, so the path is
# never hardcoded and the script works in any domain.

# Look up where the account is RIGHT NOW. Not earlier.
$dn = (Get-ADUser -Identity $Username).DistinguishedName


#--- EDIT 3: THE MOVE ---------------------------------------
# Inside its own ShouldProcess block. A move is reversible,
# but reversible is not the same as harmless, and anything
# that changes a live system gets declared.

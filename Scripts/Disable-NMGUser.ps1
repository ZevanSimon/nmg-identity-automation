.SYNOPSIS
    Documents and disables a single Active Directory account.

.DESCRIPTION
    Steps 1 and 2 of SOP-IAM-001. Captures the account and its group
    memberships to timestamped CSV files, then disables the account and
    stamps it with the authorising ticket number.

    Refuses to act on an account that does not exist, is already
    disabled, or appears to be a service account.

.PARAMETER Username
    The SamAccountName of the account to offboard. Mandatory.

.PARAMETER Ticket
    The authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000. Mandatory.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Disable-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "hgrady" -Ticket "NMG-0211" -WhatIf
    Runs every check and reports what it would do, changing nothing.

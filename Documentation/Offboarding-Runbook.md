# User Account Offboarding

**Document:** SOP-IAM-001
**Author:** Zevan Simon
**Raised under:** Ticket NMG-0203
**Approved by:** R. Ito, Privacy Office

## Purpose

Defines the complete sequence for offboarding a user account at
Northstar Medical Group. Before this document, no written
offboarding standard existed.

## Before you begin

- There is a ticket from a named requester.
- Username, display name and department all match.
- No legal hold prevesnts action on this account.
- The account belongs to a person, not a service.

## Procedure

### 1. Document the current state
Export every attribute and group membership to a timestamped file.
Removed memberships cannot be recovered, so the record is taken
before anything changes.

### 2. Disable the account
Blocks authentication. This is the step that reduces risk, so it
happens as early as the record allows. Stamp the description with
the ticket number.

### 3. Reset the password
A random value nobody holds. If the account is ever re-enabled by
mistake, the old credential must not still work.

### 4. Remove group memberships
Disabling removes no access. Stripping the groups means a
re-enabled account can reach nothing. Domain Users is the primary
group and is skipped.

### 5. Move to the Disabled Users OU
Quarantine, so the account is never mistaken for active staff.
Last, because moving changes the object path and invalidates
earlier references.

## Retention and disposal

Retained in the Disabled Users OU for the period the retention
policy defines, then deleted on a documented schedule. Where a
legal hold is in place the clock stops and nothing is deleted
until Counsel releases it in writing.

Disabled accounts are evidence. You disable a leaver.
You do not delete them.

## Tooling

All five steps of this procedure are implemented in
`Scripts/Disable-NMGUser.ps1`.

    .\Disable-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "oradcliffe" -Ticket "NMG-0213"

Both parameters are mandatory. The script will not run without
an authorising ticket number.

### What the tool refuses to do

The script stops, without making any change, if:

- The named account does not exist.
- The account is already disabled.
- The account appears to be a service account.
- The ticket number is not in the form NMG-0000.
- The group membership export did not write a file.
- The export file exists but contains no rows.
- The Disabled Users OU cannot be found.

### Why step 4 has a gate in front of it

Removing group memberships is the only step in this procedure
that cannot be reversed. The CSV written moments earlier is the
only record that will ever exist of what the account could
reach, so the script reads that file back from disk and counts
the rows before the removal is reachable.

### Why step 5 goes last

Moving an object changes its distinguished name. Every earlier
step refers to the account at its original location, so a move
performed first would cause the remaining steps to fail against
a path that no longer exists.

### Checking before acting

The script supports `-WhatIf`. All three destructive operations
are declared, so a dry run performs every check and changes
nothing. Run it with `-WhatIf` first, and verify the result
rather than trusting the output.

## Reporting

`Scripts/Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1` reports how many accounts
have been offboarded, how many are offboarded but not yet moved,
and how many remain. It takes no parameters and makes no changes
of any kind. It is safe for anybody to run at any time.

## Known exceptions

Two accounts, hgrady and rpace, were offboarded before step 5
was implemented and were moved into the Disabled Users OU
manually afterwards. Their evidence files and logs therefore do
not record the move.
